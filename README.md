# Enterprise Analytics: Logistics and Portfolio Optimization

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the ALY 6050 Introduction to Enterprise Analytics course at Northeastern University. It encompasses two main sections: a logistics optimization problem for Rockhill Shipping & Transport Company and a portfolio optimization task to achieve minimum risk for a given return.

## Logistics Optimization
- **Objective**: Minimize transportation costs for hazardous waste from six plants to three disposal sites.
- **Approach**: Utilized Linear Programming (LP) in Excel Solver to determine the most cost-effective shipping routes, considering direct and intermediate shipping scenarios.
- **Outcome**: Developed a model that minimized shipping costs while ensuring compliance with waste disposal capacities and safety regulations.

## Portfolio Optimization
- **Objective**: Allocate a $10,000 investment across six assets to achieve a minimum expected return of 11% with the least risk.
- **Approach**: Employed Quadratic Programming to model and solve the asset allocation problem, varying the baseline return to observe the risk-return trade-off.
- **Outcome**: Identified an optimal investment strategy that minimized risk while meeting the desired return, demonstrating the effectiveness of the quadratic model in portfolio management.

## Tools and Techniques
- Excel Solver for LP and quadratic programming
- Covariance matrix and expected returns for asset analysis
- GRG Nonlinear Method for optimization in Excel
